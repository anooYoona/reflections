How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    Quickier!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easier to check the bugs and improve the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    Sometimes forget to save if manually. Automatically saving is easy but not very meaningful sometime.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Useful. Because some files are related to each other, one change all change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to see all the commits and use git diff and the two different commit id to check the difference. Remember to use the u and d key or up and down key or < and > key to see the scroll up and down or get to the head and end of the file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Very much

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To see if it works with R. Really need such a function, which can navigate the history.
