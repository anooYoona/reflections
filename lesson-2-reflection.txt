How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	It can let several into one stage and make only one commit to them all.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	several files together make one commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Very helpful. I won’t be afraid of testing some new features.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	distinguish different branches and know the update for each branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	It’s quite interesting to merge them together. There some conflicts when I merge them. So I used git reset to get to a previous period and git stash to make everything right. Still a little bit confused of how it works, but it works.
	Use a diagram to visualize things is quite useful for better understanding and more clear.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	when conflict happens manually, no conflicts automatically.
