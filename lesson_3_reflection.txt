When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
	When I am working on the way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Someone else would probably make some changes maybe I don’t need them. So it would be better to do it manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks: clone the other people’s work GitHub.
	clones: clone the works from GitHub to local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Got an updated version is always good.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Maybe use email, google drive? Git and GitHub is much better.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	a new feature probably should be added. Very nice to use it to talk with others and decide whether to do it or not.
